// Commenting out the following for now, which belongs in an onboarding tour (Stetson, 4 March 2021)

When you're in the {Product_short} environment, you will see a left menu panel. This panel provides access to all resources related to the service, including the `Quick Starts` and `Documentation`.

In the lower left of the screen you'll see a lightbulb icon. This icon gives access to the `Resource Center`. Here you can find the latest information about the service, like product updates, upcoming events, etc.

The center of the page shows you the list of Kafka instances that are currently running within your organisation. If this is your, or your organisations, first interaction with {Product_short}, this list will be empty.
